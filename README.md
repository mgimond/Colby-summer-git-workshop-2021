# Intro to Git and Github


## Installing Git

* For **Windows**, Git can be installed from https://gitforwindows.org/. Go with the default installation  options. 
* For **Macs**, Git can be installed from  http://git-scm.com/downloads. Go with the default installation options. 

> Note 1: The  installers may install both a GUI and a Bash Git environment. This workshop will work exclusively in the Bash environment.

> Note 2: Some students have experienced issues installing Git on their Macs. A workaround that seems to work can be found [here](git_mac_issue.md).

## Creating a GitHub account

If you do not have a GitHub account already created, do so by pointing your browser to https://github.com/. Note that there are different plans to choose from. You will select the free version.

## What is Git

Git is a locally installed application used to keep track of changes made to a folder/files. In its simplest use,  it allows you to create versions of a project folder that you can revert to at anytime in your workflow. In its advanced use, it can create simultaneous versions of a project folder (called *branches*) whereby you chose to explore what/if scenarios in a an analysis. You can also assign different authors to different branches with each branch tackling a specific task.  Git is a part of a family of software applications calles *versuion control systems*.

Git is available in both a GUI and a command line environment.

## What is GitHub

GitHub is a web hosted service  used to store and maintain code based projects. While its a compltely separate envirnment from Git (Git and GitHub are developed and maintained by separate entities), they are often used together in a typical workflow: You use git on your computer to track changes in a project folder, then use GitHub to host and share you project across the web.
